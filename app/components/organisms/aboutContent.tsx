        Born and brought up in Ipswich, a toen in the heart of Suffolk, England
        in or around the 1970&#39;s. TS managed to avoid all the normal things
        that people did, like getting a job or a pension and instead pursued a
        life of nail biting unpredictability.

        There were bands and guitars, bikes and cars. Mad hat trips around
        Europe and a gig at a collage in Germany, which was very strange. A
        little too much Wiliam Gibson, something by the Police, bandana&#39;s
        that were way too small (they gave him a headache), jeans from a pear in
        SanFran and too many horses. Really, WAY too many horses.

        The years were packed with couch surfing, penny scrounging DJ&#39;ing
        and twenty foot mural painting. Somewhere along the way he learned how
        to code and went with the flow. A flow that went, as it turns out, all
        the way to India. He finally made his way home, some twenty years later,
        and is now tending an old Victorian house in a small market town on the
        Norfolk borders with his loving wife and daughter.

              The fact that, in this day and age, when we have AI running
              everything, self driving cars and all those other mircals of the
              modern world, do we, as coders still rely on command line
              interfaces for the most mission critical aspects of a project!
              Someone please put a GUI on it! GRRRR!{" "}
