        Born and brought up in the town of Ipswich, Suffolk in the UK on or
        around the 1970&#39;s. TS managed to avoid all the normal things that
        people did, like getting a job or a pension and instead pursued a life
        of nail biting unpredictability.

        There where bands and guitars, bikes and cars. Mad hat trips around
        Europe and a gig at a collage in Germany, which was very strange. A
        little too much Wiliam Gibson, a record by the Police, a bandana that
        was way too small (gave him a headache) and way too many horses.

        The years where packed with couch surfing, penny scrounging DJ&#39;ing
        and twenty foot mural painting. Somewhere along the way he learned how
        to code and went with the flow. A flow that went all the way to India.
        He finally made his way home, some twenty years later, and is now
        tending an old Victorian house in a small market town on the Norfolk
        borders with his loving wife and irritating daughter (just kidding,
        she&#39;s lovely really!).
